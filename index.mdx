KUtils is a powerful utility module that streamlines
common Roblox development tasks through intuitive, concise functions.

Here's how KUtils transforms verbose Roblox code into elegant solutions.
Compare these two approaches for tweening an object:

**Using KUtils**

```lua
local k = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.KUtils)
local info = k.tweenInfo(0.5, "Circular", "Out")

k.tween(
    {game.Workspace.Baseplate, info,
        {Position = Vector3.new(0, 64, 0)}
    }
)
```
<Tip>
    We like referencing the KUtils module as `k` in our examples.
    You don't have to do this in your code, but it's nice for shortening things.
</Tip>

**Traditional approach**

```lua
local tweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
local info = TweenInfo.new(0.5, Enum.TweenStyle.Circular, Enum.TweenDirection.Out)

local tween = tweenService:Create(game.Workspace.Baseplate, info,
    {Position = Vector3.new(0, 64, 0)}
)

tween:Play()
```

Even though they do the same thing, you'll likely find that using KUtils makes it more readable.
KUtils' tween function eliminates boilerplate code by:

* Managing service references internally
* Reducing the amount of required services
* Handling tween creation and playback automatically

The tween function is just one of KUtils' many great utilities.
