## Function

```lua
function module.localSound(
  id: string,
  duration: number,
  volume: number,
  speed: number,
  position: number,
  parent: Instance
)
  local sound = Instance.new("Sound")
  sound.RollOffMode = Enum.RollOffMode.Linear
  sound.RollOffMinDistance = 60
  sound.RollOffMaxDistance = 240
  sound.SoundId = id
  sound.Volume = volume
  sound.PlaybackSpeed = speed
  sound.TimePosition = position
  sound.Parent = parent
  sound.SoundGroup = game.SoundService.AllSounds
  sound:Play()

  if duration == -1 then
    sound.Ended:Connect(function()
      sound:Destroy()
    end)
  else
    debris:AddItem(sound, duration)
  end
end
```

## Example

```lua
kutils.localSound("5801257793", 1, 0.5, 1, 0, game.Workspace)
```

## Advantages

* Automatically destroys the created sound after the provided duration.
<Tip>
  Setting the duration to `-1` will make KUtils
  remove the sound after it finishes playing.
</Tip>
* Function defaults are smart and optimal for things like sound effects.
* Flexible and gives you full control over essential sound properties.

<Tip>
  When used on the client, the `localSound` function only makes the sound locally.
  You can get around this by using a server script or setting up a remote event.
