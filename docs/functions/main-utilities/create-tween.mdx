description: "Documentation for KUtils' create tween function"

### Function

```lua
function module.createTween(object, info: TweenInfo, properties)
  return tweenService:Create(object, info, properties)
end
```

### Example

```lua
local tween = k.createTween(
  {workspace.Baseplate, k.tweenInfo(0.5, "Circular", "Out"),
    {
      Position = Vector3.new(0, 64, 0),
      Color = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)
    }
  }
)

tween:Play()
```

<Note>
  The `createTween` function is really only useful for creating a tween and playing it back later. It's not able to take multiple tweens at once. If you're looking for something like that, please use the `tween` function instead.
